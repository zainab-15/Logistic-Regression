# Logistic-Regression

## Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates how the Gradient Descent Algorithm can be used to solve a Logistic Regression problem, providing an alternative to using libraries like scikit-learn. It offers an educational insight into the underlying mechanics of logistic regression by implementing it from the ground up.

 ## Project Overview

Logistic Regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used for binary classification tasks. This project focuses on:
	•	Implementing Logistic Regression using the Gradient Descent optimization algorithm.
	•	Understanding the step-by-step process of minimizing the cost function.
	•	Comparing the custom implementation with standard library approaches.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following key files:
	•	Logistic-Regression.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the implementation of Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
	•	README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Technologies Used
	•	Programming Language: Python ￼
	•	Libraries:
	•	NumPy
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started
	1.	Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/zainab-15/Logistic-Regression.git
    cd Logistic-Regression


	2.	Install the required libraries:
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary libraries:

       pip install numpy matplotlib


	3.	Run the Jupyter Notebook:

      jupyter notebook Logistic-Regression.ipynb

This will open the notebook in your default web browser, allowing you to interact with the code and visualize the results.

## Results

The notebook provides visualizations to illustrate:
	•	The convergence of the cost function over iterations.
	•	The decision boundary learned by the model.

These visual aids help in understanding how the Gradient Descent algorithm optimizes the model parameters.
